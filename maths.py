mean = sum of elements / n(number of elements)

median 1. if n is odd  median(X) = X(n+1/2), here X is ordered list of elements

mode = l + ((f1-f0)/(2f1-f0-f2)) * h   where, h - element size, f - ferquency of occurrence, l - lower element

variance = (âˆˆ(xi - mean)**2)/n  square sum of all 0 to n-1 diff of Xi-mean divided by n

Standard devitaion = variance**0.5  sqrt of variance
